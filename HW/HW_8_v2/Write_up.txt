In the scrabble project, I implemnted the following features:

-I implemented a full board with all of the double letter, double word, triple letter, and triple word
-The program will check to make sure the first letter is dragged onto the star and that following letters are adjacent
-The program can save a word and reset your rack while keeping track of every word you have played thus far
-Tiles can be reset to their original places
-The program allows you to reset the board back to what it was originally before you placed specific tiles
-Extensive error checking to be sure a correct move is made (no diagonal letters, letters must be adjacent, etc.)

Bugs:

-When an message is printed at the top of the screen, it will currently shift all of the elements on the page down which
makes it so the rack no aligns with the letters. I have tried fixing this by making the error messages absolute in CSS which
did not work. I also attempted changing to fixed that appeared to be more annoying to me than the bug itself.
